Module 10




Take Charge of Your Learning - I have always struggled to take charge when learning a new skill. I am interested in learning how to code and will take the time necessary to not fall back on work by knowing what I need to do first and taking notes throughout the classes.


Put in the Time - I have been working with my time management and know I still struggle in that department but I understand more now on how to handle my time. I know that if I want to do well in this course, I need to be the one in charge of my time. By creating a schedule and setting times for when to do homework, work, and family time, it gives me the comfort to not worry. 




Try Things on Your Own - I enjoy exploring and experiencing unique environments as a whole. But I will still struggle with keeping an interest. I am easily distracted and lose interest fairly quickly. But I know what my goals are and have something that will keep me pushing. 


Be an Engaged Student - I know I will struggle with the engaging part of the portion. Not because I am scared to engaged but mostly because I don’t want to ask a stupid question. But I know that with all the support I am getting I will feel comfortable to engage and reach out.
